# Quick sort

Quick sort is the recursive implementation.
The function sort array of integer values.
The function returns nothing. 
The algorithm uses Hoareâ€™s Partition Scheme.  
The function takes last element as pivot, places
the pivot element at its correct position in sorted
array, and places all smaller than pivot to left of pivot
and all greater elements to right of pivot
