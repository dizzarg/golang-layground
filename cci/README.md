# Cracking the Coding Interview

Solutions for Cracking the Coding Interview in Golang.

Chapter 1 problems:
1. *Is unique*. Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.
1. *Are permutation*. Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.
1. *URLify*. Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20: 
You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, 
and that you are given the "true" length of the string.
1. *Palindrome Permutation*. Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. 
A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. 
A permutation is a rearrangement of letters.The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
1. *One Away*. There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a character, 
or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away.
1. *String Compression*. Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. 
For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2blc5a3. If the "compressed"string would not become smaller than the 
original string, your method should return the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a - z).
1. *Rotate Matrix*. Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees.
1. *Zero Matrix*. It set zeros if entire row or column 0.
1. *String Rotation*. Checks if one word is a substring of another.

Chapter 2 problems:
1. *Remove duplicates*. Remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.
1. *Return Kth to Last*. Find the kth to last element of a linked list.
