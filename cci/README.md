# Cracking the Coding Interview

Solutions for Cracking the Coding Interview in Golang.

Problems:
* *Is unique*. Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.
* *Are permutation*. Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.
* *URLify*. Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20: 
You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, 
and that you are given the "true" length of the string.
