# Cracking the Coding Interview

Solutions for Cracking the Coding Interview in Golang.

Problems:
1. *Is unique*. Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.
1. *Are permutation*. Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.
1. *URLify*. Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20: 
You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, 
and that you are given the "true" length of the string.
1. *Palindrome Permutation*. Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. 
A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. 
A permutation is a rearrangement of letters.The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
